## UFOs

# Overview
The purpose of this repo is to host files allowing users to research UFO sightings based on location or date.

# Results
Specifically, users can input city, state, and country filters, plus a date range, to narrow in on a specific sighting. This tool can also be used to research the history of UFO sightings in a given area, and to track changes over time.

Additionally, there is an option to filter by shape of the UFO, which would also allow for a user to see if there were multiple sightings of what was possibly the same object in a given period of time.

# Summary

One drawback to this page is that the underlying dataset does not dynamically update. A future implementation would be to incorporate a web scraping system to allow for the site to update on a daily or weekly basis from known good sources of this information.

Additionally, it would be great to add additional tags to the data, like additional descriptors (lights? movement?).
